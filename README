This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1748

Toggles words and preserves case. The words will get converted like this:

  on -> off
  On -> Off
  ON -> OFF
 
any other case gets converted to lowercase, e.g.:

  tRUe -> false

Inspired from vimscript #1676
All I really wanted besides what that script did, was the ability to
preserve the case of words.

Usage:
Once installed it will give you a ToggleWord() command and will map it by
default to "<leader>t". All you need to do is position the cursor over the word
you want to toggle and press \t in normal or visual mode.
