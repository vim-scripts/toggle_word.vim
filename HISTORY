HISTORY

v1.0 Sat Dec 30 14:02:35 EET 2006
 - Initial release

v1.1 Sat Dec 30 17:59:50 EET 2006
 - Simplified the dictionary format. Now you don't have to worry about quotes,
   commas and square brackets anymore, it's all "just text".

v1.2 Fri Jan  5 17:27:01 EET 2007
 - Refactored the code a little bit.

v1.3 Wed Jan 17 23:14:24 EET 2007
 - Refactored the code once again.
   This time I appealed to the Ruby Talk community for a review of my Ruby 
   code, and some great solutions came up, way better than what I found. I
   picked one that's simply amazing, preprocessing everything ahead of time 
   and when the toggle is called, simply return the appropriate value.
   Many thanks to Gary Wright for this beautiful solution, the entire thread
   can be can be found here:

 - Initially introduced the Vim7 version of the plugin.

 - Added documentation.

 - Changed the default binding from ,t to <leader>t

v1.4 Wed Jun  4 09:16:31 EEST 2008
 - Loaded a more comprehensive base dictionary trying to make
   the plugin more useful out of the box. Suggestions for
   adding more entries to the default dictionary are welcome;

 - Changed the way that the user defined (g:toggle_words) 
   dictionary works: it now gets merged into the default one,
   so you can simply skip the entries already defined in the
   base dictionary unless you need to override them.

 - Retired the 'ruby' version of the plugin. You can fetch it from v1.3
   if you need it, but no further development will be done on it
