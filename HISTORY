 - Refactored the code once again.
   This time I appealed to the Ruby Talk community for a review of my Ruby 
   code, and some great solutions came up, way better than what I found. I
   picked one that's simply amazing, preprocessing everything ahead of time 
   and when the toggle is called, simply return the appropriate value.
   Many thanks to Gary Wright for this beautiful solution, the entire thread
   can be can be found here:
