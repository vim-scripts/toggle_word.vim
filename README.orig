Description:
Toggles words and preserves case, e.g. on -> off; On -> Off; ON -> OFF
while still only needing to specify each pair only once.

Initially inspired from vimscript #1676 ; all I really wanted besides what 
that script did, was the ability to preserve the case of words, but without 
specifying  multiple pairs as in [on off], [On Off], etc.

NOTE: This plugin requires either Vim6+ compiled with +ruby or Vim7.

Please see INSTALL for install & configuration notes.


Usage:
Once installed it will give you a ToggleWord() command and will map it by
default to "<leader>t". All you need to do is position the cursor over the 
word you want to toggle and press \t in normal or visual mode.

Any feedback is highly welcome :-)
