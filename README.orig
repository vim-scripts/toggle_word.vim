Toggle Word

Version: 1.4
Last Change: Wed Jun  4 09:16:31 EEST 2008
Author: Alexandru Ungur <alexandru@globalterrasoft.ro>
Requires: Vim 7



Description:
  Toggles words and preserves case, e.g. on -> off; On -> Off; ON -> OFF
  while still only needing to specify each pair only once.

  Initially inspired from vimscript #1676 ; all I really wanted besides what 
  that script did, was the ability to preserve the case of words, but without 
  specifying  multiple pairs as in [on off], [On Off], etc.


Installation:
  Simply copy the plugin/* files to your vim plugins folder.


Configuration:
  The plugin comes with a basic dictionary (please see plugin/toggle_word.vim)
  but can easily be extended by defining any aditional word pairs into your
  config file (typically .vimrc on unices) like this:

      let g:toggle_words = { 'tomorrow' : 'yesterday' }

  The user definied dictionary will be appended to the basic one. It will 
  override any existing keys, so for example if you define this:

      let g:toggle_words = { 'true' : 'untrue' }

  'true' will no longer be toggled to 'false' but to 'untrue' instead.


Usage:
  Once installed it will give you a ToggleWord() command and will map it by
  default to "<leader>t". All you need to do is position the cursor over the 
  word you want to toggle and press \t in normal or visual mode.


Feedback is more than welcome :-)
